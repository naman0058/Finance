			<P>And, whereas, the Government, after considering the matter in
			detail, have decided to introduce and implement the scheme for the
			benefit of the State Government employees;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>Now, therefore, the Government of Sikkim hereby makes the
			following scheme, namely,-</P>

			Government Employees at a low cost and on a wholly contributory
			and self financing basis, the twin benefits of an Insurance cover

			regulated by or under the provisions of the Constitution or any
			other law for the time being in force.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>Such Sikkim Government servants to whom the &quot;Scheme&quot;
			applies will, hereafter, be referred to as &quot;employees&quot;.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Membership.-</P>
			<P>(1) The 'Scheme' shall be compulsory for all those employees
			who enter Sikkim Government Service after 1st&nbsp;April, 1993.</P>

			Service as on 1st&nbsp;&nbsp;April 1993 shall have an option to
			opt out of the 'Scheme'. This option should be exercised within
			sixty days from the date of publication of this scheme in the
			official gazette. Those employees who do not opt out of the
			'Scheme' within sixty days from the date of publication of this
			scheme in the official gazette shall be deemed to have become</P>
			<P>members of the 'Scheme' from the date the 'Scheme' is
			implemented, i.e. 1st&nbsp;January 1994. The option once exercised
			or not exercised shall be treated as final and no further choice
			shall be available.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>(3) The employees of Police Department who have a separate
			Group Insurance Scheme will also have option to become members of
			this 'Scheme'. They should also exercise this option within sixty
			days from the date of publication of the 'Scheme' in the official
			gazette. Those such employees of the Policed Department who do not
			opt for the 'Scheme' will be deemed to have opted out of the
			scheme. The option once exercised</P>
			<P>(or not exercised) will be treated as final and no further
			choice will be available.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>(4) After the 'Scheme' has come into force, all employees who
			enter service on or after 2nd&nbsp;January of any year shall be
			enrolled as members of the 'Scheme' on the next anniversary of the
			'Scheme', i.e. from 1st&nbsp;January next year as further
			explained in paragraph 6 below.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subscription for
			Members.-</P>
			<P>(1) The subscription for the 'Scheme' shall be in units of
			Rs.15 per month. A Class IV employee shall subscribe for one unit,
			a Class III employee for 2 units, a Class II employee for 4 units
			and a Class I employee for a 8 units. Thus the rate of
			subscription per moth for a member of the 'Scheme' shall be as
			follows:-</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>Rate of subscription per month</P>
			<P>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class IV employees
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Rs. 15/-</P>
			<P>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class III employees
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Rs. 30/-</P>
			<P>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class II employees
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Rs. 60/-</P>
			<P>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class I employees
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Rs. 120/-</P>
			<P>(2) In the event of regular promotion of an employee from one
			Class to another, his subscription shall be raised from the next
			anniversary of the 'Scheme', to the level appropriate to the Class
			to which he is promoted. Until the date of the next anniversary of
			the 'Scheme', he shall continue to be covered for insurance for
			the same amount for which he was eligible before such promotion.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>For example, if the 'Scheme' comes into force with effect from
			1st&nbsp;January I994, a Class IV employees promoted on regular
			basis to Class III in February 1994, shall continue to subscribe
			at Rs.15/- per month up to December 1994 and be eligible for the

			January 1995, his subscription will be raised to Rs.30/- per month
			and he will become eligible for an insurance cover of Rs,30,000/-
			in addition to appropriate benefits from the Savings Fund.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premium and
			Insurance Cover for employees, other than Members.-</P>

			joining Sikkim Government Service to the date of their becoming
			member of the 'Scheme' on payment of subscription of Rs.5t- per
			month as the premium for every Rs.15,000t- of the Insurance Cover.
			From the date of anniversary of the 'Scheme', i.e. 1st&nbsp;January
			of the next year, they will pay subscription at the rates
			indicated in paragraph 5(1) above.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;For example, if the 'Scheme' comes into force with effect
			from 1st&nbsp;January 1994, a Class IV employee entering service
			in February 1994, shall pay subscription at the rate of Rs.5/- per
			month as premium for an Insurance Cover of Rs.15,000/- for a
			period of 11 months from February 1994 to December 1994 and from
			January 1995, his subscription shall be raised to Rs.15/- per
			month and he shall become eligible for the benefits from Savings
			Fund in addition to Insurance Cover of Rs.15,000t-. Similarly, a
			Class III employee entering Service in February 1994, will pay
			subscription at the rate of Rs.10/- &nbsp;per month as the premium
			for an Insurance Cover of Rs.30,000/- for a period of II months
			from February 1994 to December 1994 and from January 1995, his
			subscription shall be raised to Rs.30/- per month ad he shall
			become eligible for the benefit from the Savings Fund in addition
			to Insurance Cover of Rs.30,000/-</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance Fund
			and Insurance Cover for Members.-</P>
			<P>(1) In order to provide insurance cover to each member of the
			'Scheme', a portion of the subscription (30 percent) shall be
			credited to an Insurance Fund to be held in the Public Account of
			the State Government. The amount of Insurance Cover shall be
			Rs.15,000/- for each unit of subscription, i.e. it shall be Rs.
			15,000, Rs.30,000, Rs.60,000, Rs.I,20,000 respectively for Class
			IV, Class III, Class II and Class I employees. It shall be paid to
			the families of those employees who unfortunately die, due to any
			cause, while in Sikkim Government Service.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>(2) The positive or negative balance under the Insurance Fund
			shall be credited or debited, as the case may be, with the amount
			of interest calculated at the rate of 6 per cent per annum or as
			fixed by the State Government from time to time.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Savings Fund.-</P>
			<P>(1) The balance of the subscription, that is 70 per cent, shall
			be credited to a Savings Fund. The amount in the Savings Fund
			shall be held by the State Government in its Public Account. The
			total accumulation of the savings together with interest thereon
			shall be payable to the ,member on his retirement after attaining
			the age of superannuation or on cessation of his employment with
			the Sikkim Government or to his family on his death while in
			Service.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>(2) The benefit from the Savings Fund shall be as shown in the
			tables notified by the Government of Sikkim from year to year
			based on the year of entry up to the end of month of cessation of
			membership of the 'Scheme' on account of retirement, resignation,
			removal from service, death, etc. These tables correspond to

			'employees' who have joined the Insurance Fund or both the
			Insurance Fund and the Savings Fund under the 'Scheme' and to
